About 5 year ago, occationally I received some request from my co-workers within FedEx on python. But starting this year, it seem I received a lot requests. So intead of helping my friends on one on one basis, I am writing this simple and short instruction to speed up thing a bit more.

Some inustructions are specific for FedEx. Whenever that happens, I will specify that. As a general rule, the instruction should apply to other users as well.
