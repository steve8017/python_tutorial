This is a short note for my friends at FedEx.

It is about how to install python and its related technologie. Especially it is about how to connect to our data sources, such as Oracle (MarketView), Teradata (EDW), SAS dataset, excel spreadsheet, csv files, etc.

To make it applicable to public also, I will highlight those sections only apply to FedEx.
